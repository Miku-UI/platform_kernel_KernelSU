## How to add
```
curl -LSs "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsuntk/KernelSU/main/kernel/setup.sh" | bash -s main
```

## Hook method

1. **KPROBES hook:**
    - Only support GKI (5.10 - 6.x) Kernels in this fork. All non-GKI kernels must use manual hook.
    - Used for Loadable Kernel Module (LKM)
    - Default hook method on GKI kernels.
    - Need `CONFIG_KPROBES=y`
2. **Manual hook:**
    - For GKI (5.10 - 6.x) Kernels, add `CONFIG_KSU_MANUAL_HOOK=y` to kernel defconfig make sure to use `#ifdef CONFIG_KSU_MANUAL_HOOK` instead of `#ifdef CONFIG_KSU` to guard KernelSU hook.
    - Standard KernelSU hook: https://kernelsu.org/guide/how-to-integrate-for-non-gki.html#manually-modify-the-kernel-source
    - backslashxx's syscall manual hook: https://github.com/backslashxx/KernelSU/issues/5

## Features

1. Kernel-based `su` and root access management.
2. Module system based on [5ec1cff's Magic Mount API on KernelSU](https://github.com/5ec1cff/KernelSU)
3. [App Profile](https://kernelsu.org/guide/app-profile.html): Lock up the root power in a cage.
4. Bringing back non-GKI/GKI 1.0 support

## Compatibility State

KernelSU (before v1.0.0) officially supports Android GKI 2.0 devices (kernel 5.10+). Older kernels (4.14+) are also compatible, but the kernel will have to be built manually.

With this, WSA, ChromeOS, and container-based Android are all supported.

Currently, only `arm64-v8a` are supported.
